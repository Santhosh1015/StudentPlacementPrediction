# Student Placement Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The Student Placement Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of a student getting placed based on various academic and non-academic factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system helps institutions and students gain insights into factors influencing placements and make data-driven decisions.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Student Placement Analysis Dataset
- **Features:**
  - Academic performance (CGPA, Percentage, etc.)
  - Extracurricular activities
  - Internship experience
  - Technical skills
  - Communication skills
  - Mock interview scores
  - Placement status (Target variable)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks
- Deployment (Optional): Flask, Streamlit, or any cloud platform

## 🚦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-placement-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-placement-prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Usage
1. Prepare the dataset by placing it in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the model training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. To make predictions, run:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input sample_input.csv
   ```
4. (Optional) Launch the web app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📈 Results
- Model Accuracy: XX%
- Key Features Influencing Placement:
  - CGPA
  - Internship Experience
  - Communication Skills

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Integrate a recommendation system for skill improvement.
- Develop a dashboard for visualization.
- Implement continuous model training with new data.
